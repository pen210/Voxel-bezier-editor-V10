Voxel Curve & Arch Designer — README
Overview

Voxel Curve & Arch Designer is a tool for creating grid-aligned voxel curves, arches, and structural shapes using editable control points. It supports symmetry visualization, fine-tuned grid settings, voxel rendering, and import/export of curve data.

The program was developed with assistance from ChatGPT, as the author is not a professional developer. Because of this, some bugs or unexpected behavior may occur. Users are encouraged to explore the tool freely, modify the code, improve it, or adapt it for their own needs.

Features

Voxel Mode & Line Mode for designing shapes either as smooth curves or block-accurate voxels.

Grid-aligned editing with workspace sizes defined in blocks, not pixels.

Add unlimited control points, with visual indicators between them.

Alignment highlighting (red = normal segment, green = perfectly aligned).

Symmetry tools, including preview or automatic mirroring.

Compact settings panel with adjustable grid size, voxel thickness, and field dimensions.

Import & Export of curve data (SVG or structured coordinates).

Fully editable code, open for changes, extensions, or complete rewrites.

Usage

Add or move control points to form a curve.

Switch between voxel or curve visualization modes.

Enable symmetry if needed.

Export or import curve data as SVG/code.

Notes

The tool may contain minor imperfections due to its experimental nature.

All functionality, UI elements, and logic can be freely edited.

Contributions, fixes, or personal modifications are welcomed.
